# Quickstart
To integrate and launch the loyalty feature on your website or application, follow these three simple steps:
* Prepare the credential.
* Follow the authentication flow.
* Test and troubleshoot.

## Prepare your credentials
Navigate to the Mini-app Settings page of the ABC Loyalty 3.0 Dashboard. And get the client key and client secret that you will use in the following steps.

## Follow the authentication flow
1. Use the client ID and client secret to make a POST request to the ABC Loyalty 3.0 SaaS platform to get a JWT token. 

```sh filename="Request: Get token" {3,4} copy
curl --location --request POST 'https://abc-auth-dev.abc-dev.network/realms/partner/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id={your_client_id}' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret={your_client_secret}' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'
```

```sh filename="Response: Get token" {2} copy
{
    "access_token": {your_access_token},
    "expires_in": 1800,
    "refresh_expires_in": 0,
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "not-before-policy": 0,
}
```

2. Use the access token as an authentication bearer for the request to get a one-time token (OTT). 

```sh filename="Request: Get the Mini-app URL" {2,5} copy
curl --location --request POST 'https://api-dev.abc-dev.network/latitude-configs/v1/api/auth/ott' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "userId": {your-customer-identity}
}'
```

```sh filename="Response: Get the Mini-app URL" copy
{
    "accessToken": "DBAj1PoC6BcJvpLsdxU34C86BVz1xFI=",
    "redirectUrl": "https://{org-id}.ascendbit.io"
}

```

3. Use the redirect URL and access token from the previous step to redirect or open the loyalty application with the token. Here is an example code:

```sh /accessToken/ filename="Redirect the user" copy
https://{mini-app-url}?token=${accessToken}
```

## Test and troubleshoot 
When testing the integration or troubleshooting any issues, here are two common problems that you may encounter:

* If you cannot obtain a JWT access token, check your client ID and client secret in the Latitude console. Make sure that these credentials are correct and have been issued correctly.

* Suppose you encounter an Unauthorized page after opening the Loyalty application. In that case, you should verify that you have sent the OTT as a token request parameter in the redirect URL using the correct format: 

```sh /accessToken/ filename="Mini-app URL" {3} copy
https://{mini-app-url}?token=${accessToken}
```

By following these steps, you can help ensure your integration runs smoothly and avoid common issues that may arise during testing.
